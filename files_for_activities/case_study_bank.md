Here are some details about the relations:

- Relation "client" describes the characteristics of people who can manipulate with accounts. One client can have multiple accounts.
- Relation "disposition" links related clients and accounts. Multiple clients can manipulate with a single account.
- Relations "loan" and "credit card" describe some services which the bank offers to its clients; more credit cards can be issued to an account, at most one loan can be granted for an account.
- Relation "demographic data" gives some publicly available information about the districts (e.g. the unemployment rate); additional information about the clients can be deduced from this.

For more details about the relations and the attribute descriptions, please refer to the pdf document (`case_study_extended.pdf`).
